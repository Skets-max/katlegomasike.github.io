  <h2>Building the Industrial Attachment Management System (IAMS)</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on April 14, 2025</p>
  <p>
    The IAMS project was developed for the CSI341 - Introduction to Software Engineering course at the University of Botswana. 
    It aimed to streamline the management of student industrial attachments through a central platform for students, 
    organizations, supervisors, and administrators.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main responsibilities included designing the student and organization dashboards, building forms for registration, 
    and implementing page responsiveness using HTML and CSS. I also participated in writing the release and sprint planning 
    documents as part of our Scrum process. We used PHP and MySQL to store user data securely and support different user roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key challenge was ensuring that each dashboard displayed relevant information based on login credentials. 
    I learned how to structure layouts cleanly and apply form validation to reduce input errors. Overall, this project improved 
    my understanding of full-stack development and real-world team collaboration.

  <h2>Creating an Online Application System for UB</h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on March 30, 2025</p>
  <p>
    For my individual project in CSI315 - Web Technology and Applications, I developed a web-based Online Application System 
    for the University of Botswana. The system allows prospective students to submit applications, upload BGCSE results, and 
    get ranked based on calculated points.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built the system using XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. One of the biggest learning moments was implementing 
    the logic to calculate and rank BGCSE points automatically from uploaded subject grades. I also included document upload 
    features and basic admin functionality to approve or reject applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project really strengthened my skills in server-side scripting and working with databases. It also helped me understand 
    the importance of form usability and secure file handling in real applications.
